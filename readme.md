This is a simple Bluetooth experiment I took on, just for grins. 

It utilizes an adafruit NRF51822 module and an Atmega32u4 MCU. Keyboard firmware is QMK

The portion of the schematic concerning the NRF module is based on the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE schematic. 

A previous error in the PCB has been corrected by a contributor, but it has not been tested. 

These files are presented as-is for personal projects. They were created/uploaded in a time that I was ignorant of creating Kicad projects that were easily sharable so most likely you will get errors with schematic symbols and/or PCB footprints.
